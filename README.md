# EMD Code Challenge

Hello, welcome to my code. Main things to check out:

1. src/utils/is-valid-luhn.ts: The magic that checks if a number is valid
1. src/utils/is-valid-luhn.test.ts: Some lovely tests for my luhn function
1. src/server/api/routers/credit-card.ts: Endpoints for checking CC numbers
1. src/pages/index.tsx: Where it all comes together

Check it out here: https://emd-code-challenge-git-main-cshell7.vercel.app/

## My Process:

- (20 min) Got the app framework set up and deployed to Vercel.
- (20 min) Learned about Luhn checksum algorithm, set up checker function and endpoints.
- (35 min) Set up jest and created test cases to validate my function.
- (45 min) Set up multi input form with some basic input validation.
- (80 min) Made less ugly and various small clean ups on the code.
- (10 min) Added these notes.

Total: 210 minutes
